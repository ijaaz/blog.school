Today I bought the vesper app, and so far I'm liking it.

To put simply, the reason I bought this app is because I see the possibilities of the future. Vesper is not just a simple, beautifully designed app, but is also an app made by an all star team of great people. They have a dedication to keep it simple, but also widen the possibilies.

I'm wondering if we should buy a tablet from t-mobile. They are pretty cheap, and they have a nice 1g free plan. Honestly a tablet costs as much as a smartphone.

As really can't wait for vesper to be updated with sideways typing, they say it'll come after the Mac app comes out, whenever that is.

Today we packed a lot because we're gonna be moving in 5-6 days.

I just this interesting sub-reddit about Islam and evolution. It was really interesting because of the participants wide perspectives and difference of opinion.

Some of them made more sense than others, but it varied widely, with a 50/50 tie.
