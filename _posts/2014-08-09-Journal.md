Today I wasn't feeling well because I stayed up late last night due to tiredness and the fact that I still had stuff to do.

So I woke relatively late, and was sluggish, and not feeling well. 

My day really started a little before I took a bath/shower, specifically around 1-2pm in the afternoon.

I did eat a late breakfast, and I did have a late lunch. My lunch was huge, and late. Due to this I didn't really eat any dinner.

I also wrote some today, specifically I wrote some scenes inspired by my imaginintation.

I also read a lot on wattpad. I found a huge list (140) of good books by one of my favorite wattpad authors. So I have so much to read and so many options.

All day today I was making a creamer for my coffee using sweetened condensed milk, but it dropped in the end of the day. I'm really sad about that :(

Well I gotta go to bed, so see ya'all tomorrow :)
