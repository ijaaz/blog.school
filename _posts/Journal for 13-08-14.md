# Journal for 13-08-14

Today mom went to the house that we're gonna be moving to, and it seems to be pretty close to everything.

I'm thinking of applying to work at Starbucks as there are a couple close to where we will live.

I can't wait to move our plan from Verizon to T-Mobile so that I'll finally have unlimited music streaming. When I have unlimited streaming and a new phone, that means I'll be free from the two largest constraints I have right now.

I really am unsure which type of phone I should choose when we switch plans. Ether an android phone, or an iPhone 5s.

An iPhone has quality software, design that I enjoy, and more importantly is the OS I'm tied to since forever.

I right now use a chromebook computer, and as Chrome os is kinda made by Google, the same people that make android, I can see why an android phone could be useful.

But at the same time, macs kinda have been my dream computers for quite a while. But perhaps now that I'm moving to place that has wifi all the time, chromebook a could be even more useful.

I just don't know! What should I choose?
