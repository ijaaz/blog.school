# Journal for 17-08-14

Today I brought some of my stuff upstairs. I hope to have it finished by tomorrow.

I'm planning to buy a pinboard subscription. It costs around 10$ once.

I found last year that I needed a universal bookmarking service, and google's native bookmarking service is just sad.

I am using delicious and evernote at this moment, but I know that Evernote is just not made for that, and delicious doesn't have many third-party apps.

I also worry about delicious' privacy, and no, I really don't want people to share my private bookmarks. I mean, if I did want people to know what I was bookmarking, I'd use something like Pinterest, something made explicitly for sharing, that also had a large user base.

I'm thinking of waiting for the iPhone 6. It's only coming in a couple weeks, specifically the 9th.
