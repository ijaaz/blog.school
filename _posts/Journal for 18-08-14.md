# Journal for 18-08-14

Today I went biking on the backroads behind our house. I biked enough to work a sweat than went through the greenery to the house.

I had an argument with Fatima today. I wish to apologize for behavior.

We'll be leaving really soon. I can't wait.

I controlled my appetite today. I struggle to control my appetite everyday, somedays I'm more successful than others.

Today I found out that I should be using more coffee beans when I make my coffee. I normally use 1 tablespoon of coffee for every 6.0oz of water. But the fact is I should be using 2 tablespoons per 6oz of water. Yeah, it does seem a lot, but my coffee is now measurably better.

I can finally make my coffee taste like Starbucks coffee.

Well, that's it for now, see you guys around next time.
