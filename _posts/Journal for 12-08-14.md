# Journal for 12-08-14

Today I went biking pretty late, but still enjoyed it.

I finally found out what the issue was with my audio on the iPhone. The issue was simple, I had on mono on in the accessibility options.

I have moved from Abdullah's phone to baba's so that I will enjoy 3G access.

I searched for email client for the iPhone and found a lot, surprisingly.

I want to find an alternative to simplenote that uses Dropbox syncing instead of Simperium, but I haven't found any yet that are worthy of their price.

I'm thinking of moving from Dropbox to Google drive, that way I can take advantage of the chromebook more.

Have a good night, see ya tomorrow.
