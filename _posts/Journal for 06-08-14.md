# Journal for 06-08-14

Today I didn't really feel that well, but I did take a couple showers and found some new books on wattpad.

I found a nice new background from one of my favorite wattpad authors, so that was nice.

I also tried writing some, all I can say about is that it ain't a failure, yep, isn't a failure. 


I've found that writing on an iPhone can be pretty nice, as long as you type horizontally!

I really like Simplenote, the app I'm using to write this down. It's really simple(as the name says) but it works quite well as a distraction free writing environment, that you know, actually encourages you to write!  

I especially like the fact that I can't really name a note, so there's no actual pressure to name your thoughts, or better yet, it makes sure you don't have bunch of note called random  1, random 2, e.t.c.

There's more to talk about, but a I gotta go to bed, so bye, bye
