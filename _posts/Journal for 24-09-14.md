# Journal for 24-09-14

Today I had fun in school with Jamie.

I looked into going into journalism as a profession. It seems like a very attractive prospect for me. A combination of good hours, interesting work, and writing.

I also am making a lot of my own coffee now, which is fun. I am using a combo of my new grinder, french press, and electric water heater. I have good coffee every day now ;)

Today I was exploring some 80s rap/hip-hop. It was very ineresting because 80s rap is not like modern day rap. A lot of the rap seemed to use a synthasizer and was less about crime.

A good example would be Friends, by Whodini. Friends is all about friends, not about gangsta stuff. It was also, unlike Eminem, less lyrically focused.

Eminem is arguably the greatest rapper  that I have ever heard. Of any generation. His Rap God song is probably the best rap song ever. This is due the fast and smooth lyrics.

I am learning all about chemistry, it's pretty interesting. I also am trying to understand geometry better.
