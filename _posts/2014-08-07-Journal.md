Today I watched the kids till around 5, and wrote and read a lot.

I read a book explaining how to write better by a favorite wattpad author of mine. This inspired me to try my hand at writing, and I think it's actually happening!

So my secret to writing? Simply use Simplenote, and write in the iPhone side-ways.

Those two secret have encouraged me to write more and longer.

Simplenote helps by taking the organizing/file system out of the way, mind you, without taking away organization, search, folders, or the actual ability to make titles.

The iPhone is important because it helps you focus on one thing, and is with you every where. 

Did you know that if you tried writing sideways on an iPhone it'd be easier to use than an iPad. This is because it has less travel room, while also being lighter, and lastly, you can finally use two thumbs, just like an iPad!

Of course an iPhone has less screen room, but that just helps you concentrate on the text immediately in fron of you! 

I learned this iPhone trick from someone I met while going to ceder point on a school trip.
