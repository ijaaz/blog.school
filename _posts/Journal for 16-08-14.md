# Journal for 16-08-14

I napped for a couple hours because I didn't get as much sleep as I wanted. I fell asleep at around 6-6:30 and woke up around &-8:11. It was a restful sleep, with dreams.

Today Zain had another seizure.

I read an interesting article Nautilus about baboons and how they are more similar to us than we would think.

I also read an interesting article about Selflessness and Selfishness.
