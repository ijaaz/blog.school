# Journal for 20-08-14

Today I went all over. We did the big move today, I went to the library, and explored all over.

We got a couple guys to help us move all our junk to the new house. They are children of mom's friend from work. They are very strong dudes.

They helped us move all the big things like the couches, beds, and boxes.

Than we came home and unloaded all of the stuff to the garage. Then we started to unpack.

I later on went to the library, stayed there for a couple hours downloading stuff, than came home.

I than went exploring, passed Starbucks, went to the Musjed, went to krojers, and passed the library.

It was fun.

I'm planning to go to fajr tomorrow. It's gonna be early, but I've been waking up around than anyway.

We need to get a home phone, because how are we gonna contact people otherwise, and I don't have a phone?

I got this new app for my laptop. It's really useful. It allows me to edit Evernote offline. It also uses the first line as the title, something I've been wishing for forever.

It's called nixnote. It's not perfect, but than nothing really is. I do wish for a couple features, mainly word amount.

It is the only native app for Linux users, so you pretty much gotta live with what you have.

I also got a couple interesting icons and themes for my Linux computer.

The best one is the icons. The icons are circular, colorful, and full featured. They are made by the people that also made the awesome Numix theme.

The theme is less impressive, but still a beaut. It's a theme resembling the old Mac design. I like it because it adds some quality to my Linux desktop.

I really wish rdio had a better iOS app. I love their website, and just generally love their esthetics. But, their we app is not staying with the times, and from what I understand they fired most a lot of their employees, so no updates are going to be coming soon.

Tomorrow I'm going to get a Pinboard account. It costs over 10$ for access to Pinboard, but after that, it's done.

I need Pinboard for my universal bookmarking needs. No bookmarking service is more universal and privacy conscious than Pinboard.

I'm going to get a free year of Evernote for free. It's easy, all I have to do is make 12 fake email accounts, than use an Evernote account.

It's gonna be great! I'll finally be able to upload more and have offline access.

And just think, in 12 years, I'll be able to look back and think how stupid I was :)

I've been mostly biking recently, that's why I can go to so many places at once.

I enjoy biking more than I used to, and it's useful when you aren't using cars or public transportation.

I'm surprised, and happy, at how many places there are for my bike to go.
Even the Musjed and krogers have one.
