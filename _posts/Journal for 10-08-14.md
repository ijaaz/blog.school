I made some more coffee creamer today, and I made the best ever!

I found a new mason jar from the attic today, and it was **huge**.

I also made a lot of coffee to put in said mason jar. I also used making coffee as an excuse to use that splentaciouless coffee creamer.

I'm reading a an interesting book on wattpad. It's really interesting because that plot line is pretty rare, and the author is great.

Being depressed is not fun, which I was this night. 

Today I listened to a lot of music on spotify from this playlist called "Noon Pacific". I also found a couple favorites on Noon Pacific, like "Falling - Duke Dumont Remix", which is a really good song.

Well good night ya'all.
