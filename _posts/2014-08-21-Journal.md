Today I went to the library and Starbucks again.

I stayed at the library for a couple hours. I read books, downloaded music and ebooks, and just all around enjoyed myself.

I got a coffee at Starbucks than went to the library. I forgot that the library has it's own coffee.

So yeah, got coffee, biked to the library, and started doing things.

I finally got pinboard :) I also imported all of my old bookmarks from delicious and google bookmarks all onto pinboard.
