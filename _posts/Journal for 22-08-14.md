# Journal for 22-08-14

Today I went to the dentist to get my braces off. I now have to wear two small plastic things that go on the bottom and top of my teeth.

Today I took a bus home. There were complication issues, primarily communication, inexperience, and money problems.

I couldn't contact mom, so that was a problem.

But I was able to go to Starbucks, that was fun. I finally got unlimited free Starbucks refills. I used it while waiting for mom to call me back. I had like, 4 coffees while waiting for mom. And I enjoyed it. The barista was funny and British.

I enjoy the fact that I can stay in Starbucks all day, and have unlimited refills.

I downloaded beats music to test out. From my experiences today I feel that it is a good experience that has a couple kinks could use some tweaking and smoothing.

I already found many new songs and albums that I'd never find otherwise. The main feature I like is that they have a primarily human catalog, not a machine based engine.

I cleaned up the new kitchen this night. It's easier to clean than our old kitchen. There's less room to make messes, while still being bigger than our old kitchen.

I'm experimenting with using sticky notes as my primary means of making a todo list.

I could just use Wunderlist to make a list or organize stuff. But Wunderlist is less accessible and intuitive. I know this from my experience recently.

Of course the issue with sticky notes is that you can't carry them with you, nor can you keep them long time.

I've solved all of these issues by using Evernote. Evernote has a special mode for sticky notes; automatically organizing sticky notes based on colors, and fixing up the images, so you can take notes on the fly.

I need to cut my facial hair, it makes my look worse than normal.

I need to go to sleep, starting to think I'm falling, so see ya.
